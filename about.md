Design, Build, Test, Repeat is a [Cantina](https://cantina.co/) podcast for and about User Interface Design and Development for web applications. Hosted by [Eric Bailey](https://twitter.com/ericwbailey) and [Mike Kivikoski](https://twitter.com/mkivikoski). Recorded, cut, and mixed by Jeremy Brody.

Before joining Cantina, he worked as a designer in a diverse range of industries, including news, digital and print publishing, health and human services, as well as traditional agency design. He is a strong advocate of accessibility, and enjoys creating straightforward, device-agnostic solutions that address the practical, physical, cognitive, and emotional needs of the user.

Eric graduated from Montserrat College of Art with a Bachelors of Fine Arts focusing in Graphic Design. In his spare time he enjoys reading, building small web toys, and compulsively checking Twitter.

### Mike Kivikoski
Mike Kivikoski is a Designer and Developer, specializing in User Interfaces and User Experience. With over 10 years of professional experience, Mike crafts solutions to User and Client problems. Mike is an expert in clearly defining problems, sketching/ideation, and design-build for possible solutions.

Mike has a video series with O’Reilly books, “UI Introduction for Engineers”, and has spoken at Creative Mornings, Ignite, Refresh Boston, Harvard and Endicott College. Prior to joining Cantina, Mike spent 5 years running his own consultancy, working with small and large companies building a variety of products, from simple marketing sites to complex multi-device applications. Mike has taught as an Adjunct Professor at Endicott College, teaching “Introduction to Web Development”, “Advanced Web Development”, and “Introduction to Web Design”. He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts with a concentration in Visual Communication, from Endicott College.

Outside of Cantina, Mike likes to do DIY projects and garden while dreaming of owning a Hobby Farm. He enjoys time with his family and their great dane, Baron, and generally spending as much time outdoors as possible.

### Jeremy Brody
Jeremy started out in information retrieval and large corpus data integrations at a search engine. From there, he branched out into management and design of low-latency streaming media infrastructure and video and photo production for Morgan Stanley. Most recently, he’s been managing, designing and developing scalable web applications for a few clients including Parsons Brinckerhoff.

When he’s not compulsively researching all manner of the useful and not so useful, Jeremy enjoys taking [sometimes professional] photos, cooking and eating. Is eating a hobby?

When not eating, he can be found backpacking, skiing, sailing or doing pretty much anything else outdoors. He also loves making furniture, and is [not so] secretly building the skills to make a wooden boat to sail around Narragansett Bay.
